                The first time I had an interaction with a computer was at the age of 14. Hardware was what ignited my curiosity. I'd disassemble it and put it
                back together.  At the age of 16 I built my own computer from scratch and installed my first Operating System.
                Never the less, my name is Lungelo Packery and I'm an aspiring software engineer.
                I am easily inspired by robotics and astronomy. Seeing humans strive and pushing the limits
                to achieve what was known 20 years ago as impossible triggers the will to do the impossible.
                It might take 7 maybe 10 years but my end goal includes a Doctor of Philosophy in computer Sciences and
                securing the most meaningful career in this field. Needless to say that my skills will one day enable me to
                travel the world.
